# Programming Journey: C# OOP & SQL

This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress and work in C# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and SQL programming. It will serve as a place for me to document and showcase the concepts, exercises, and projects I am learning throughout my programming journey.

- [C# OOP Programming](#c-sharp-oop-programming)
- [SQL Programming](#sql-programming)
- [Future Work](#future-work)

## Introduction Week

The first week is focused on the basic introduction to C# programming, understanding fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the foundation of SQL programming. During this week, I will cover:
- Setting up a C# development environment
- Understanding basic data types, variables, and control structures in C#
- Introduction to SQL queries and databases

## C# OOP Programming

As I progress with C#, I will dive deeper into object-oriented programming concepts. The following topics will be explored:
- Classes and objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Interfaces and events
- Exception handling

Each folder or file in this section will document and demonstrate a specific concept, as well as provide sample code and explanations for better understanding.

## SQL Programming

Alongside C#, I will explore SQL programming, including:
- Basic SQL commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Joins, subqueries, and advanced querying
- Database normalization
- Data manipulation
- Stored procedures and triggers

The SQL section will track my progress with practical examples, exercises, and any projects related to SQL databases.

## Future Work

As I continue to learn and grow, I will keep adding new projects, examples, and explanations related to C# OOP and SQL. The repository will evolve with my knowledge and skills in these areas.

Feel free to explore and contribute to any ideas or improvements in my coding journey!
